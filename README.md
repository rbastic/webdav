This is a fork of gogits/webdav. Please see PocketDAV unless you are interested
in helping improve this repository.

I'm not interested in the following: RFC compliance, passing litmus tests, et cetera.
Before you spit in my face, I assure you, I have the best of intentions. Don't we all?

[TODO: maybe I should patch this README up before I commit.]

notes from gogits:
